# Sauti 116 Brand Identity: Imagery & Visual Guidance

To ensure the Sauti 116 brand identity remains inclusive, respectful, and survivor-centered, follow these visual guidance rules. Our goal is to shift from a "Clinical/Emergency" feel to a **"Warm/Protective Sanctuary."**

## 1. Emotional Tone: Warmth & Protection
The visual experience should lower the user's heart rate, not increase it.
- **Warmth**: Use soft lighting in photography and warm neutral backgrounds (`--color-surface-warm`). Avoid clinical white-only spaces.
- **Protection**: Visuals should emphasize stable, safe structures (community centers, schoolrooms, calm helpline offices).
- **Trust**: Professional helpline staff should be seen as accessible and empathetic, not as unapproachable authorities.

## 2. Accessible & Warm Color Palette
Our colors are chosen to balance **Visibility** with **Calm**.
- **Sauti Trust Blue (`#0066A3`)**: The primary anchor for stability and professional care.
- **Warm Amber (`#EA580C`)**: High-visibility for the "Call 116" action, but warmer and less alarming than pure "Emergency Red."
- **Relief Green (`#558B2F`)**: Signals a successful path to safety and growth.
- **Warm Ivory (`#FBFBF9`)**: Use as the base background to reduce eye strain and provide a "human" feel.

## 3. Imagery Style Guidelines
### Photographic "Dos" (Focus on Sanctuary)
- **Active Listening**: Show helpline counselors leaning in, wearing headsets, with calm and focused facial expressions.
- **Resilience & Agency**: Focus on the strength of the survivor. Show people in motion—walking towards a community center, talking to a counselor, or interacting with a trusted adult.
- **Authentic Lighting**: Prioritize natural, warm sunlight. Avoid harsh, flat fluorescent lighting.

### Photographic "Don'ts" (Avoid Alarming Tropes)
- **No "Victimhood" Tropes**: Avoid photos of people crying, in shadows, or "reaching out" from darkness. These can be triggering.
- **No Alarming Icons**: Avoid sirens, flashing lights, or "STOP" signs. We are a helpline, not a law enforcement raid.
- **No Staged "Sadness"**: Avoid obviously staged stock photos of children sitting alone in corners.

## 4. Diversity & Representation
Imagery must signal that Sauti 116 is for **everyone** in Uganda.
- **Generational Diversity**: Include elders (who often act as community gatekeepers) and youth.
- **Urban & Rural Balance**: Show the helpline service reaching both the streets of Kampala and rural villages.
- **Inclusive Ability**: Represent persons with disabilities in active, dignified roles.

## 5. Technical Requirements for Web
- **Soft Overlays**: Use a very light Trust Blue or Sandstone overlay (5% opacity) on full-screen hero images to soften the visual impact.
- **Accessible Alt Text**: Contextualize the feeling of the image (e.g., *"A calm counselor in a sunlit office, listening intently while wearing a headset"*).
- **WebP format**: Ensure files are under 400KB to maintain fast loading on low-bandwidth mobile networks.
