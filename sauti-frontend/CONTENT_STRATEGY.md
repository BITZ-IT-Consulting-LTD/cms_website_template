# Sauti 116: Scannable Content Architecture Guide

This guide defines how we write and structure content for users experiencing high emotional stress, which often results in degraded cognitive processing and low attention spans.

## 1. The "Sanctuary" Content Layout
- **Z-Pattern Scannability**: Place the most critical action (e.g., "CALL 116") in the top-right or center visual path.
- **Empty Space as Breathing Room**: Maintain a minimum of `py-20` (80px) between distinct content blocks to prevent visual overwhelm.
- **Single-Column Focus**: On mobile and stress-heavy pages, stick to a single column to reduce horizontal eye movement.

## 2. Heading Structure: "The Verdict First"
Instead of descriptive headings, use **Verdict Headings** that answer the user's immediate question.

| Topic | Legacy Heading | Verdict Heading (Stress Optimized) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Privacy | Privacy Policy | We Protect Your Private Information |
| Reporting | Reporting Process | Your Step-by-Step Path to Safety |
| Contact | Contact Information | Reach Our Expert Team Anytime |
| About | Our History | 10+ Years of Keeping Children Safe |

## 3. Paragraph vs. Bullet Guidance
- **Max Paragraph Length**: 3 sentences. If it's longer, it must be broken up into a bulleted list.
- **Iconic Bullets**: Never use plain dots. Use themed icons (Shield, Check, Arrow) to provide secondary visual meaning before the text is read.
- **Bold "Key Phrases"**: Bold the most important 3-4 words in a paragraph so they can be read in isolation.

## 4. The "Flash Summary" Pattern
Every long informational page (Privacy, Terms, About) must begin with a **Flash Summary** block.

### Example: Privacy in a Flash
> **Quick Summary for Your Peace of Mind:**
> - **We are Private**: Your phone number will not show on your bill.
> - **We are Secure**: Your story is encrypted and read only by experts.
> - **We are On Your Side**: We only share data if it's needed to keep you safe.

## 5. Action Triggers
Never leave the user at a "dead end." Every content block must end with:
1. A **Primary CTA** (e.g., "Get Help Now")
2. OR a **Secondary Navigation** (e.g., "See How We Protect You")

---
**Goal**: A user should be able to understand the "Safety Verdict" of any page in under 5 seconds of scanning.
