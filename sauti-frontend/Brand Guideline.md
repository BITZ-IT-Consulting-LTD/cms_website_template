## 1. Introduction & Overview
### The Purpose
This document provides guidelines to ensure the correct use of the SAUTI 116 brand identity when creating and producing materials for all communications, campaigns, and events.

### About the Brand
The Sauti 116 brand represents a collaborative mechanism between the government, private sector, and NGOs to advocate against **Violence Against Children (VAC)** and **Gender-Based Violence (GBV)**. It is a technology-based service linking communities in need of protection to counseling, rescue, health, and justice resources.

## 2. Brand Story & Journey
### Evolution
- **2005**: First toll-free Child Helpline launched in Uganda (0800 numbers).

- **2013**: Short code 116 designated as an emergency number.
- **2021**: Scaled up to report **Gender Based Violence (GBV)** alongside child protection, leading to the current rebranded identity.

### Service Framework (Three Tiers)
1.  **National Call Centre**: 24/7/365 contact center with professional counselors providing guidance and escalating cases.
2.  **Satellite/Action Centres**: District-level Probation and Social Welfare Offices where caseworkers pool efforts for integrated response.
3.  **Referral Partners**: A network of medical, psychosocial, legal, and emergency care providers.

## 6. Brand Enforcement Checklist
- [x] **Remove "National"**: The brand is simply **Sauti 116**.
- [x] **Logo Alignment**: Centered vertical relationship with descriptor text.

- **Weights**: Light, Regular, Semi-Bold, Bold.
- **Standard Size**: 11 Points for body text.

*Headers only.*
- **Usage**: Primarily for campaigns requiring extreme emphasis (Condensed Black or Bold weights).
- **Note**: Always use Cronos Pro for body text even when Helvetica is used for headers.

---

## 7. Photography & Inclusive Representation
Photography must reflect the brand’s reality: **Sauti 116 serves everyone.** Visuals must represent the full spectrum of our community—Children, Adolescents, Adults, Caregivers, and Elders.

### Core Principles
- **Inclusivity**: Every campaign must visually represent at least two distinct age groups (Stratas) to reinforce our whole-community mission.
- **Dignity-First**: Never use imagery of people in states of distress, vulnerability, or as "victims." Focus on the agency of the helper and the strength of the survivor.
- **Authenticity**: Avoid generic "overly-polished" stock photography. Use real Ugandan settings, lighting (dawn/dusk), and natural interactions.

### Approved Image Themes
- **Community Dialogue**: Multi-generational groups (Elders + Youth) engaging in protection conversations.
- **The Modern Helpline**: Diverse professional staff (Male/Female, various ages) providing high-tech, compassionate counseling.
- **Safe Adolescence**: Empowered teenagers using technology to stay safe and connected.
- **Caregiver Support**: Parents and guardians learning protection techniques from Sauti caseworkers.

### Rejected Image Themes
- **Child-Only Bias**: Avoid site-wide imagery that represents only children; this alienates adult survivors of GBV.
- **Sensationalism**: No crying faces, bruised skin, or hand-over-mouth tropes.
- **Staged Diversity**: Avoid "office-suit" models that look disconnected from the Ugandan grassroots reality.
- **Generic Voids**: No photography that lacks a sense of place (Uganda's unique urban or rural textures).

## 9. Trust Signal Conflict Resolution (Audit)
*The following items have been flagged for potential removal to streamline branding, but represent a direct conflict with public trust expectations.*

### Flagged for Removal [STATUS: PENDING APPROVAL]
- **Attribution**: "A Government of Uganda Initiative"
- **Descriptor**: "Official Governance & Protection Mechanism"

### Risk Analysis
1. **Credibility Gap**: Removal of "Government" attribution may lead survivors to doubt the service's power to intervene in justice or rescue operations.
2. **Authority Dilution**: Sauti 116 derives its mandate from the Ministry (MGLSD). Visibility of this mandate is non-negotiable for official trust.
3. **Fraud Protection**: Official badges distinguish Sauti 116 from private initiatives or unauthorized service providers.

### Proposed "Digital Endorsement" Hierarchy
Rather than repetitive text, use a structured trust hierarchy:
- **Sub-Footer**: Single inclusion of the **MGLSD Crest** with text: *"Official Helpline of the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development."*
- **Contact Page**: Retain "Official Government Service" badge to reassure users at the point of high-stakes interaction.
- **Hero/Header**: Proceed with streamlined "Sauti 116" branding for speed and accessibility, relying on the footer for formal authority.

## 10. Font Governance & Approval Gate (Audit)
*A request has been made to revert to generic system fonts (Roboto Sans) and neutralise text colours. This represents a significant brand deviation.*

### Flagged for Approval [STATUS: APPROVAL REQUIRED]
- **Typeface Change**: Reverting from **Cronos Pro** to **Roboto Sans**.
- **Color Neutralization**: Converting all body and sub-header text to solid black, removing brand accents (Deep Green/Sky Blue).

### Impact on Brand Recognition
1. **Loss of Voice**: Cronos Pro is selected for its "Humanist" quality—it feels safe, approachable, and professional. Roboto is a neutral utility font that lacks the unique "helping hand" personality of Sauti 116.
2. **Generic Perception**: Reverting to standard web-fonts reduces the perceive authority of Sauti 116 as a specialized national protection service, making it look like a generic template.
3. **Navigational Degradation**: Removing brand-specific text colors (like Sauti Deep Green for stability) removes the visual "anchors" that help vulnerable users navigate complex information.

### Proposed Typography Hierarchy
- **Primary**: **Cronos Pro** (Mandatory for all digital platforms).
- **Secondary**: **Helvetica Neue** (Condensed emphasis only).
- **Digital Fallback**: `system-ui, sans-serif` (Only used if assets fail to load).
- **Text Color**: Body text should be **Sauti Solid Black** (C0 M0 Y0 K100), but sub-headings and labels should retain **Sauti Deep Green** or **Sauti Sky Blue** for structural clarity.

## 11. Messaging & Content-Level Brand Audit
*Language is the first touchpoint of safety. We have identified a conflict between "UX Simplicity" and "Brand Urgency" in the CTA language.*

### Flagged for Approval [STATUS: APPROVAL REQUIRED]
- **Removal of "Violence"**: Changing "Report Violence" to generic terms like "Report Online" or "Start a Report."

### Risk Analysis
1. **Reduced Urgency**: Survivors and neighbors may feel less "civic duty" if the language is too soft or corporate. "Violence" reinforces the gravity of the 116 mission.
2. **Ambiguity of Action**: "Report Online" is a generic web interaction. In a state of stress, a user may confuse this with reporting a technical issue or a general site error.

### Messaging Comparison Table
| Current / Requested | UX Sentiment | Brand Conflict | Recommended Wording |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Report online" | Clean / Scannable | **High Conflict**: Dilutes the mission. | **"Report Violence Online"** |
| "Click here to report" | Instructional | **Medium Conflict**: Too generic. | **"Report Abuse Online"** |
| "Start a Report" | Direct | **Low Conflict**: Soft but clear. | **"Protect Someone Online"** |

**No More Silence. End the Violence. Call 116.**
